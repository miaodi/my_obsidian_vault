# Node
## Node level feature
### Node degree
### Node centrality
A node $v$ is important if it is surrounded by important neighboring nodes $u\in N(v)$ 

$$ c_v = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{u\in N(v)} c_u \leftrightarrow \lambda \mathbf{c}=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{c}$$
- $\mathbf{A}$: Adjacency matrix
- $\mathbf{c}$: Centrality vector
### Betweenness centrality
A node is important if it lies on many shortest paths between other nodes.
$$ c_v=\sum_{s\neq v\neq t}\frac{\# \text{(shortest paths between s and t that contain v)}}{\# \text{(shortest paths between s and t)}}$$
### Closeness centrality
Anode is important if it has small shortest path lengths to all other nodes
$$c_v=\frac{1}{\sum_{u\neq v} \#\text{(shortest path length between u and v)}}$$
### Clustering coefficient
Measures how connected $v$'s neighboring nodes are:
$$e_v=\frac{\# \text{(edges among neighboring nodes)}}{\binom{k}{2} }\in \left[0, 1\right]$$
### Graphlets ???
Clustering coefficient counts the #(triangles) in the ego-network
